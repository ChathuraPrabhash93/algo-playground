## Question ðŸ¤”
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example<br>
>***s = "ab#c"***
> 
>***t = "ad#c"***

Return<br>
Both `s` and `t` become `ac`. Hence return,
>***true***

* First one will be the brute force solution where we are loop through each string and build a new string doing the 
(backspace)operation. It'll take `O(n)` time and space complexities.
* Second one is in from another approach, and It's also take `O(n)` time and space complexities.
