* First one will be the brute force solution where we are loop through each possible substring and 
keep looking the duplicate values using a `set`. It'll take `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` space 
complexities.
* Second one also another brute force solution, and It's also take `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` space 
complexities.
