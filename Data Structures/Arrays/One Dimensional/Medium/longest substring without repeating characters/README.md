* First one will be the brute force solution where we are loop through each possible substring and 
keep looking the duplicate values using a `set`. It'll take `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` space 
complexities.
* Second one also another brute force solution, and It's also take `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` space 
complexities.
* Third one is more optimized solution which uses the *Sliding Window* technic. It just takes `O(n)` time and space
  complexities.

> **Sliding Window**: Form a window over some ***portion*** of ***sequential*** data, then move that window
> throughout the data to capture different part of it.
