## Question ðŸ¤”

Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

Example:<br>
***n = 10***<br>
***queries = [[1, 5, 3],[4, 8, 7],[6, 9, 1]]***

Queries are interpreted as follows:
> a b k<br>
> 1 5 3<br>
> 4 8 7<br>
> 6 9 1<br>

Add the values of `k` between the indices `a` and `b` inclusive:

|     Index     |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 | 10 |
|:-------------:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|---:|
| Initial value |    0  |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |  0 |
|   Step one    |       3       |   3 |   3 |   3 |   3 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |  0 |
|   Step two    |       3       |   3 |   3 |  10 |  10 |   7 |   7 |   7 |   0 |  0 |
|  Step three   |       3       |   3 |   3 |  10 |  10 |   8 |   8 |   8 |   1 |  0 |

The largest value is `10` after all operations are performed.

#### Brute Force Solution
> ***NOTE***: This logic is works, but fails the time constraint. There is a better solution in the below.

> ***Thought process***: As per above explanation you can see we just need to get the cumulative total from each step, only between the `start` and `end` indexes.

1. We are using a HashMap to keep total from each iteration since it takes constant time to access elements.
2. We are iterating over the `queries` and access the `start`, `end` and `k` values.
3. Then for that `start` index to `end` index adding the `k` value to the HashMap with index.
   1. First get the current value of the `j`th index; if it's null putting a new value otherwise add it to the existing value.
   2. Finally, check the current `j`th value is largest or not.
4. When the loops are over we have the largest value and returned it.
