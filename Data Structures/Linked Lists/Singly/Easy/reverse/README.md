## Question ðŸ¤”
Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is 
reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Example<br>
`head*` refers to the linked list with `data` values:<br>
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL`

Manipulate the `next` pointers of each node in place and return `head`, now referencing the head of the list:<br>
`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL`

> ***NOTE***: Anyone curious to learn about LinkedLists from scratch [here is a good article](https://medium.com/@prabhash.code/java-collections-under-the-hood-linkedlist-e01-8444a0bb4544) which explain the implementation of the `java.util.LinkedList`.

1. As guide in the question we need to change the `next` pointers of the node. So we maintain the 3 pointers for 
`current`, `previous` and `next` nodes.
2. Then we are changing the pointers of the nodes until the `current` node is empty. 
Here is the illustration of how the variables are assigns after each loop for above example.

|   variable   | initial | #1  |  #2  |  #3  |
|:------------:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:----:|
|     next     |  null   |  2  |  3   | null |
| current.next |    2    |  3  | null | null |
|   previous   |  null   |  1  |  2   |  3   |
|   current    |    1    |  2  |  3   | null |
3. We can see finally the `previous` provide what we are need i.e. reversed LinkedList.
